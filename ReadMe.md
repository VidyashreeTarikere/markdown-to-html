**You can always count on me for opening the door as I have the badge. P.S. I have because I live nearby. Yet to earn it**

_I would like to contribute with the theory behind the stuff we code like, say, how memory works. Also, maybe something about Computer Networks, if anyone is interested._

### Something funny which happened when I was in Kindergarden ,
As soon as I started kindergarden, I was very happy to finally leave home and do something(sarcastic). I didn't cry for a week but then saw other kids crying and started weeping everyday after going to school. I feel this is not really funny. But can't think of anything else.

To summarize, the story was not really funny.
